REST stands for Representational State Transfer

-->
It is an architectural style for designing APIs.

Not a framework or protocol.

📌 Example
Designing URLs and HTTP methods in a standard way.


-->set of constraint 

1)REST is about resources

Examples:

User

Order

Product

Payment

Blog post

Each resource is identified by a URL:

/users
/users/10
/orders/202

The API exposes resources, not actions.


2).JSON is just a representation

REST says:

A resource can have multiple representations

Common representations:

JSON ✅ (most common)

XML

HTML

Plain text

YAML


4).
Core principles of REST (VERY IMPORTANT)
1️⃣ Client–Server separation

Client and server are independent

Frontend doesn’t care how DB works

Backend doesn’t care how UI is built

👉 Enables scalability and independent development


2️⃣ Statelessness (MOST IMPORTANT)

Each request must contain all information needed.

❌ Server should not remember client state
✅ Every request is independent

Example:

GET /orders
Authorization: Bearer <token>

3️⃣ Uniform Interface

Proper HTTP methods

GET → read

POST → create

PUT / PATCH → update

DELETE → delete

c) Standard HTTP status codes

200 OK

201 Created

400 Bad Request

401 Unauthorized

404 Not Found

500 Server Error

4️⃣ Representation of state

When client interacts with server:

Client sends representation (JSON/XML)

Server processes it

Server returns a new representation

Hence the name:
Representational State Transfer


5️⃣ Cacheability

Responses should indicate if they are cacheable:

Cache-Control: max-age=3600


This improves performance.


6️⃣ Layered system

Client should not know:

Whether it’s talking to cache

Load balancer

API gateway

Microservice
