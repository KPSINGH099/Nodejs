Why login must use POST
1. Credentials must not appear in URL

GET sends data in the URL query string:

/login?username=john&password=12345


❌ Password becomes visible in:

Browser history

Server logs

Network logs

Bookmark

Proxy logs

✔ POST hides the credentials

POST sends the data in the request body, not the URL.

POST /login
{
  "username": "john",
  "password": "12345"
}


This is much safer (still use HTTPS).

✅ 2. GET is meant for retrieving data

Login is not retrieving data — it is an action that changes state:

Creates a session/token

Validates password

Logs security event

So GET is semantically wrong.

☑️ 3. POST supports larger payload & JSON

GET has size limits.
POST is designed for form submissions and JSON bodies.

👍 Final Answer: Login should use → POST
Correct route
router.post("/login", (req, res) => {
  const { email, password } = req.body;
  res.send("Logged in successfully");
});


If you want, I can also give:

Login + JWT example

Login + session example

Login best practices (rate limiting, bcrypt hashing)

Just tell me!

You said:
but post creates data here we are not creating data
ChatGPT said:

Great question — this is a very common confusion.

You’re right that POST is often used to “create data”, but in REST POST actually means something broader:

✅ POST = perform an operation that cannot be expressed as GET/PUT/DELETE

Login is not retrieving data, not updating data, not deleting data.

Login is an action (validate credentials + generate session/JWT).
REST uses POST for actions.

🔥 Important: LOGIN is NOT a data CRUD operation

Logging in does this:

Check password

Generate JWT/session

Set cookies

Update last login timestamp

Possibly invalidate old tokens

This is an operation, not a resource creation.

🚫 Why NOT GET?
GET must NOT:

Change server state

Modify session

Generate tokens

Write logs

Create cookies

But login does all of these.

And GET puts credentials in the URL:

/login?user=abc&pass=123


❌ Leaks passwords in browser history, server logs, proxies.

✔ So even though POST can create resources…
…it is also used for non-idempotent operations, including:

Login

Logout

Search with filters

Complex forms

Payment initiation

OTP verification

Upload

Reset password

Session refresh

These are not CRUD but still use POST.

📌 REST Meaning of POST

According to HTTP spec:

POST is used for processing, submitting, or triggering operations, not just creating.

So login fits perfectly.

✅ Final Answer
Login should use: POST

because it is an operation that changes authentication state and must not expose credentials.

If you want, I can show:

🔹 /login (POST) with JWT generation
🔹 /logout (POST) with token blacklist
🔹 Best REST structure for authentication
