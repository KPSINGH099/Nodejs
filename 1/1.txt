Express processes middleware and routes top → bottom, exactly in the order they appear.


9. Why must GET routes never perform login or modify server state?

(GET is idempotent & cached → unsafe)
ChatGPT said:

Here is the cleanest, interview-ready explanation of why GET must never be used for login or anything that changes server state:

✅ 1. GET is idempotent
Meaning:

Doing the same GET request 1 time or 100 times must produce the same result and no side effects.

But login does:

Creates a session token

Updates last-login time

Writes logs

Invalidates previous sessions

So login changes state → violates idempotency.

✅ 2. GET requests can be cached

Browsers, proxies, and CDNs cache GET responses.

If login was done using GET:

A browser might cache the login response

Proxy/CDN might serve a cached authenticated response

Someone may log in without credentials due to caching 😱

Very dangerous.

✅ 3. GET puts data in the URL → insecure

If login parameters were sent like this:

/login?user=kishan&password=12345


Password is exposed in:

Browser history

Proxy logs

Server logs

Analytics tools

Bookmarks

Total security leak.

✅ 4. GET can be triggered by accident

Examples:

By clicking a link

By browser prefetch

By bots crawling your site

By copy-pasting URLs

Imagine login being triggered accidentally just by opening a URL → not acceptable.

✅ 5. GET is intended ONLY for retrieval

By HTTP standards:

GET is for retrieving data only
Not for performing actions

Login is an action, not retrieval.

🎯 Interview One-Line Answer

GET must never perform login or modify server state because GET is idempotent, cacheable, and exposes parameters in the URL. Using GET for login is insecure and violates HTTP semantics.

26. What happens if next("error") is called?

It skips normal handlers and calls the error-handling middleware.
