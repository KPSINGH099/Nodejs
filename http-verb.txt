ist of Common HTTP Verbs + Meaning

Below are the verbs you must know as a backend developer:

1️⃣ GET
Use: Retrieve data

Should NOT modify server state

Should be safe, idempotent, cacheable

Example:

GET /users
GET /products/10

2️⃣ POST
Use: Create data or perform non-idempotent actions

Used for login

Used to submit forms

Body is allowed

Example:

POST /users
POST /login

3️⃣ PUT
Use: Update entire resource

Idempotent → calling it 1 time or 10 times results in same outcome.

Example:

PUT /users/5     // replace user 5 completely

4️⃣ PATCH
Use: Partially update a resource

Not necessarily idempotent.

Example:

PATCH /users/5   // update only name

5️⃣ DELETE
Use: Remove a resource

Idempotent → deleting 10 times has same result.

Example:

DELETE /users/5

6️⃣ OPTIONS
Use: Check which HTTP methods a route supports

Often used automatically for CORS.

Example:

OPTIONS /users

7️⃣ HEAD
Use: Same as GET but without the response body

Used by browsers and crawlers to check metadata.

Example:

HEAD /download/file

🎯 Why HTTP Verbs Are Important in REST APIs

They allow you to build clean, meaningful routes:

HTTP Verb	Path	Meaning
GET	/users	fetch all users
POST	/users	create a user
GET	/users/10	get user 10
PUT	/users/10	replace user
PATCH	/users/10	update user
DELETE	/users/10	delete user

This keeps your API predictable, scalable, and standardized.
