ist of Common HTTP Verbs + Meaning

Below are the verbs you must know as a backend developer:

1️⃣ GET
Use: Retrieve data

Should NOT modify server state

Should be safe, idempotent, cacheable

Example:

GET /users
GET /products/10

2️⃣ POST
Use: Create data or perform non-idempotent actions

Used for login

Used to submit forms

Body is allowed

Example:

POST /users
POST /login

3️⃣ PUT
Use: Update entire resource

Idempotent → calling it 1 time or 10 times results in same outcome.

Example:

PUT /users/5     // replace user 5 completely

4️⃣ PATCH
Use: Partially update a resource

Not necessarily idempotent.

Example:

PATCH /users/5   // update only name

5️⃣ DELETE
Use: Remove a resource

Idempotent → deleting 10 times has same result.

Example:

DELETE /users/5

6️⃣ OPTIONS
Use: Check which HTTP methods a route supports

Often used automatically for CORS.

Example:

OPTIONS /users

7️⃣ HEAD
Use: Same as GET but without the response body

Used by browsers and crawlers to check metadata.

Example:

HEAD /download/file

🎯 Why HTTP Verbs Are Important in REST APIs

They allow you to build clean, meaningful routes:

HTTP Verb	Path	Meaning
GET	/users	fetch all users
POST	/users	create a user
GET	/users/10	get user 10
PUT	/users/10	replace user
PATCH	/users/10	update user
DELETE	/users/10	delete user

This keeps your API predictable, scalable, and standardized.

HTTP verbs define the action to be performed on a resource. They make REST APIs meaningful, predictable, and easy to maintain.


************************************************************************
1. What are HTTP verbs, and why are they used?

They are methods (GET, POST, PUT…) that tell the server what operation the client wants to perform on a resource.
***********************************************************************

. What is idempotent in HTTP?

An operation giving the same result no matter how many times it’s repeated.

Idempotent methods: GET, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS
Not idempotent: POST
**********************************************************************
7. Safe vs unsafe HTTP methods?

Safe: GET, HEAD → don’t modify resources

Unsafe: POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH → change server state

**********************************************************
8. What are HTTP status codes?

Codes representing the result of a request, grouped into:

1xx → Info

2xx → Success

3xx → Redirect

4xx → Client error

5xx → Server error

*********************************************. When to use 200 vs 201 vs 204?

200 OK: Successful GET

201 Created: New resource created

204 No Content: Success but no response body
****************************************************
10. What is OPTIONS used for?

To check allowed HTTP methods for a route; used in CORS preflight.

11. What is HEAD used for?

Same as GET but returns headers only — no body. Used for cache validation.

12. What is a REST API?

An API following REST constraints: stateless, resource-based, uniform interface.

13. REST vs RESTful?

REST = theory/architecture
RESTful = real implementation following REST constraints

14. What does “stateless” mean?

Server does not store session data. Each request carries all required info (token, auth).

15. Resource naming rules?

Use plural nouns:
/users, /orders/123/items

Avoid verbs in URL:
❌ /createUser
✔ /users

16. Why avoid verbs in URL paths?

HTTP verbs already indicate actions.
URL should represent nouns/resources, not actions.

************************************************************************


. What is global middleware?

Applied at app-level:

app.use(logger)


Runs for every incoming request.

40. What is router-level middleware?
router.use(authMiddleware);


Runs only inside that router.


. How to apply middleware on specific routes?
router.get("/profile", auth, handler);

Why do POST/PUT/PATCH require CSRF protection?

Because these change server state and can be triggered by malicious sites.
