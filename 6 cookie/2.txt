app.use(cookieParser()); ---

Express does NOT parse cookies automatically.

console.log(req.headers.cookie);

--cookie will be print if it is already Threaded


❌ You get raw string, not usable easily.


What cookie-parser actually does internally
1️⃣ Reads raw cookie header
req.headers.cookie

2️⃣ Parses it into key-value pairs
{
  token: "abc123",
  theme: "dark"
}

3️⃣ Attaches it to req
req.cookies
