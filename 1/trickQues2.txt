Difference Between router.use() and router.get()
1️⃣ Purpose
router.use()

Used to apply middleware.

Runs for all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)

Runs for all routes that match the path prefix.

Example:

router.use("/admin", (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("Middleware for all /admin routes");
  next();
});


This will run for:

GET /admin

POST /admin/login

PUT /admin/settings

DELETE /admin/user

router.get()

Used to handle GET requests only.

Not a middleware for other methods.

Example:

router.get("/admin", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Admin GET route");
});


Only runs for:

GET /admin
❌ Not for POST /admin
❌ Not for PUT /admin

✅ 2️⃣ Matching Behavior
router.use("/path")

Matches any route starting with /path.

Example:

router.use("/user", middleware);


This matches:

/user
/user/profile
/user/settings/edit

router.get("/path")

Matches route exactly.

Example:

router.get("/user", handler);


This matches:

/user


Not:

/user/profile
/user/edit
