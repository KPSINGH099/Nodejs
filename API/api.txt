API


what is api?

Application Programming Interface 

->enables communination between softwares

->communination needed to use one another functionality 

->we do not need to expose our code and data to third party Application
instead we provide api which enables to acess our features/data

-->third party application can not make change to codebase which makes application secure

-->API acts as a contract between systems

It defines what is available, how to access it, and what data format to use.

-->
API hides internal implementation details

The client does not need to know:

How data is stored

Which language is used

How business logic works


-->API defines inputs and outputs

Input → request parameters / payload

Output → response data

-->API can be local or remote

Local API: File system API, OS API

Remote API: Web APIs (HTTP/REST/SOAP)
